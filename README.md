# mps

MPS (Multi Precision Simulator) is a tool designed to simulate multi-precision floating-point numbers while capturing differences in computation time. The core idea is to reimplement all binary floating-point operations at the bit level, using boolean values in C++.

The code shown here represents the main implementations used in my Masterâ€™s thesis in Computational Science at the University of Vienna.

## Usage 

To build the project run the following script: 

```
run_build.sh
```
